The Linux GCC and Windows MinGW builds in this project are supported via a CodeLite project file.
Codelite is a very cool open source C++ IDE, it can be found here: http://www.codelite.org/
Other GCC build methods aren't actively supported but contributors and maintainers are welcome to do so!
Just drop me a line and I'll see about adding you to the project's svn write access list.
