; Set the following to 1 if we have EDSP instructions

OC_ARM_ASM_EDSP		*	@HAVE_ARM_ASM_EDSP@

; Set the following to 1 if we have ARMv6 media instructions.
OC_ARM_ASM_MEDIA	*	@HAVE_ARM_ASM_MEDIA@

; Set the following to 1 if we have NEON (some ARMv7)

; Set the following to 1 if LDR/STR can work on unaligned addresses
; This is assumed to be true for ARMv6 and later code
OC_ARM_CAN_UNALIGN	*	0

; Large unaligned loads and stores are often configured to cause an exception.
; They cause an 8 cycle stall when they cross a 128-bit (load) or 64-bit (store)
;  boundary, so it's usually a bad idea to use them anyway if they can be
;  avoided.

; Set the following to 1 if LDRD/STRD can work on unaligned addresses
OC_ARM_CAN_UNALIGN_LDRD	*	0
