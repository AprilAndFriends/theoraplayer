libyuv's source code is here provided in minimalist distribution format
with all source files not needed for compiling libtheoraplayer removed.

- The project files were modified to fit libtheoraplayer's binary output
  folder structure.
- Some project files missing in the original source distibution were added to support
  compiling the libtheoraplayer on those platforms.
- Also, some code may have been changed to address certain compiler/platform
  specific problems and is so indicated in the source code.

libyuv is owned and maintained by the Google Inc. and this distribution
is present here only for convenience and easier compilation of libtheoraplayer.

If you want to use libyuv outside of libtheoraplayer, it is encouraged to use the
original source distribution by Google Inc: https://code.google.com/p/libyuv/
